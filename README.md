## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This repository bridges the gap between **theory and practice**.  
It contains:
- **From-scratch implementations** to understand how algorithms work  
- **Conceptual notebooks** explaining the intuition behind key AI/ML ideas  
- **Visual explorations** for quick, intuitive learning
